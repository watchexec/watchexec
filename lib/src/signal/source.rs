	/// This signal is available because it is a common signal used to reload configuration files,

	/// on to a sub process.
	Hangup,

	/// Received to indicate that the process should stop.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGINT`. On Windows, this is `Ctrl+C`.
	///
	/// This signal is generally produced by the user, so it may be handled differently than a
	/// termination.
	Interrupt,

	/// Received to cause the process to stop and the kernel to dump its core.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGQUIT`. On Windows, it is not produced.
	///
	/// This signal is available because it is reasonable that it could be passed on to a sub
	/// process, rather than terminate watchexec itself.
	Quit,

	/// Received to indicate that the process should stop.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGTERM`. On Windows, this is `Ctrl+Break`.
	///
	/// This signal is available for cleanup, but will generally not be passed on to a sub process
	/// with no other consequence: it is expected the main process should terminate.
	Terminate,

	/// Received for a user or application defined purpose.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGUSR1`. On Windows, it is not produced.
	///
	/// This signal is available because it is expected that it most likely should be passed on to a
	/// sub process or trigger a particular action within watchexec.
	User1,

	/// Received for a user or application defined purpose.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGUSR2`. On Windows, it is not produced.
	///
	/// This signal is available because it is expected that it most likely should be passed on to a
	/// sub process or trigger a particular action within watchexec.
