Please delete this template text before filing, but you _need_ to include the following:

- Watchexec's version
- The OS you're using
- A log with `-vvv --log-file` (if it has sensitive info you can email it at felix@passcod.name â€” do that _after_ filing so you can reference the issue ID)
- A sample command that you've run that has the issue

Thank you
