.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Recursively monitors the current directory for changes, executing the command when a filesystem change is detected\. By default, watchexec uses efficient kernel\-level mechanisms to watch for changes\.
.
.P
At startup, the specified \fIcommand\fR (passing any supplied \fIargument\fRs) is run once, and watchexec begins monitoring for changes\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fIcommand\fR
Command to run when watched files are modified, and at startup, unless \fB\-\-postpone\fR is specified\. All \fIargument\fRs are passed to \fIcommand\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exts\fR \fIextensions\fR
Comma\-separated list of file extensions to filter by\. Leading dots are allowed (\.rs) are allowed\. (This is a shorthand for \fB\-f\fR)\.
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR \fIpattern\fR
Ignores modifications from paths that do not match \fIpattern\fR\. This option can be specified multiple times, where a match on any given pattern causes the path to trigger \fIcommand\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal <SIGKILL|SIGHUP|...>\fR
Sends the specified signal (e\.g\. \fBSIGKILL\fR) to the child process\. Defaults to \fBSIGTERM\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-shell\fR
Execute command directly, do not use \fBsh -c\fR\. This is especially useful in combination with \fB--signal\fR, as the signal is then send directly to the specified command\. While \fB--no-shell\fR is a little more performant than the default, it prevents using shell-features like pipes and redirects\.
.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\fR \fIpattern\fR
Ignores modifications from paths that match \fIpattern\fR\. This option can be specified multiple times, and a match on any pattern causes the path to be ignored\.
.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-watch\fR \fIpath\fR
Monitor a specific path for changes\. By default, the current working directory is watched\. This may be specified multiple times, where a change in any watched directory (and subdirectories) causes \fIcommand\fR to be executed\.
.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-restart\fR
Terminates the child process group if it is still running when subsequent file modifications are detected\. By default, sends \fBSIGTERM\fR; use \fB\-\-kill\fR to send \fBSIGKILL\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clear\fR
Clears the screen before executing \fIcommand\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-postpone\fR
Postpone execution of \fIcommand\fR until the first file modification is detected\.
.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Prints diagnostic messages to STDERR
.
.TP
\fB\-\-force\-poll\fR \fIinterval\fR
Poll for changes every \fIinterval\fR ms instead of using system\-specific notification mechanisms (such as inotify)\. This is useful when you are monitoring NFS shares\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-vcs\-ignore\fR
Skip loading of version control system (VCS) ignore files\. By default, watchexec loads \.gitignore files in the current directory (or parent directories) and uses them to populate the ignore list\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Processes started by watchexec have the \fB$WATCHEXEC_UPDATED_PATH\fR environment variable set to the path of the first modification observed\. In addition, the \fB$WATCHEXEC_COMMON_PATH\fR environment variable is set to the common path of all observed modifications\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
