# DESCRIPTION

Execute commands when watched files change.

Recursively monitors the current directory for changes, executing the
command when a filesystem change is detected (among other event
sources). By default, watchexec uses efficient kernel-level mechanisms
to watch for changes.

At startup, the specified command is run once, and watchexec begins
monitoring for changes.

Examples:

Rebuild a project when source files change:

\$ watchexec make

Watch all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for changes:

\$ watchexec -e html,css,js make

Run tests when source files change, clearing the screen each time:

\$ watchexec -c make test

Launch and restart a node.js server:

\$ watchexec -r node app.js

Watch lib and src directories for changes, rebuilding each time:

\$ watchexec -w lib -w src make

# OPTIONS

**\--manual**

:   Show the manual page

    This shows the manual page for Watchexec, if the output is a
    terminal and the man program is available. If not, the manual page
    is printed to stdout in ROFF format (suitable for writing to a
    watchexec.1 file).

**\--completions**=*SHELL*

:   Generate a shell completions script

    Provides a completions script or configuration for the given shell.
    If Watchexec is not distributed with pre-generated completions, you
    can use this to generate them yourself.

    Supported shells: bash, elvish, fish, nu, powershell, zsh.

**\--only-emit-events**

:   Only emit events to stdout, run no commands.

    This is a convenience option for using Watchexec as a file watcher,
    without running any commands. It is almost equivalent to using
    \`cat\` as the command, except that it will not spawn a new process
    for each event.

    This option implies \`\--emit-events-to=json-stdio\`; you may also
    use the text mode by specifying \`\--emit-events-to=stdio\`.

**-h**, **\--help**

:   Print help (see a summary with -h)

**-V**, **\--version**

:   Print version

\[*COMMAND*\]

:   Command (program and arguments) to run on changes

    Its run when events pass filters and the debounce period (and once
    at startup unless \--postpone is given). If you pass flags to the
    command, you should separate it with \-- though that is not strictly
    required.

    Examples:

    \$ watchexec -w src npm run build

    \$ watchexec -w src \-- rsync -a src dest

    Take care when using globs or other shell expansions in the command.
    Your shell may expand them before ever passing them to Watchexec,
    and the results may not be what you expect. Compare:

    \$ watchexec echo src/\*.rs

    \$ watchexec echo src/\*.rs

    \$ watchexec \--shell=none echo src/\*.rs

    Behaviour depends on the value of \--shell: for all except none,
    every part of the command is joined together into one string with a
    single ascii space character, and given to the shell as described in
    the help for \--shell. For none, each distinct element the command
    is passed as per the execvp(3) convention: first argument is the
    program, as a path or searched for in the PATH environment variable,
    rest are arguments.

# COMMAND

**\--shell**=*SHELL*

:   Use a different shell

    By default, Watchexec will use \$SHELL if its defined or a default
    of sh on Unix-likes, and either pwsh, powershell, or cmd (CMD.EXE)
    on Windows, depending on what Watchexec detects is the running
    shell.

    With this option, you can override that and use a different shell,
    for example one with more features or one which has your custom
    aliases and functions.

    If the value has spaces, it is parsed as a command line, and the
    first word used as the shell program, with the rest as arguments to
    the shell.

    The command is run with the -c flag (except for cmd on Windows,
    where its /C).

    The special value none can be used to disable shell use entirely. In
    that case, the command provided to Watchexec will be parsed, with
    the first word being the executable and the rest being the
    arguments, and executed directly. Note that this parsing is
    rudimentary, and may not work as expected in all cases.

    Using none is a little more efficient and can enable a stricter
    interpretation of the input, but it also means that you cant use
    shell features like globbing, redirection, control flow, logic, or
    pipes.

    Examples:

    Use without shell:

    \$ watchexec -n \-- zsh -x -o shwordsplit scr

    Use with powershell core:

    \$ watchexec \--shell=pwsh \-- Test-Connection localhost

    Use with CMD.exe:

    \$ watchexec \--shell=cmd \-- dir

    Use with a different unix shell:

    \$ watchexec \--shell=bash \-- echo \$BASH_VERSION

    Use with a unix shell and options:

    \$ watchexec \--shell=zsh -x -o shwordsplit \-- scr

**-n**

:   Shorthand for \--shell=none

**-E**, **\--env**=*KEY=VALUE*

:   Add env vars to the command

    This is a convenience option for setting environment variables for
    the command, without setting them for the Watchexec process itself.

    Use key=value syntax. Multiple variables can be set by repeating the
    option.

**\--no-process-group**

:   Dont use a process group

    By default, Watchexec will run the command in a process group, so
    that signals and terminations are sent to all processes in the
    group. Sometimes thats not what you want, and you can disable the
    behaviour with this option.

    Deprecated, use \--wrap-process=none instead.

**\--wrap-process**=*MODE* \[default: group\]

:   Configure how the process is wrapped

    By default, Watchexec will run the command in a process group in
    Unix, and in a Job Object in Windows.

    Some Unix programs prefer running in a session, while others do not
    work in a process group.

    Use group to use a process group, session to use a process session,
    and none to run the command directly. On Windows, either of group or
    session will use a Job Object.

**\--stop-signal**=*SIGNAL*

:   Signal to send to stop the command

    This is used by restart and signal modes of \--on-busy-update
    (unless \--signal is provided). The restart behaviour is to send the
    signal, wait for the command to exit, and if it hasnt exited after
    some time (see \--timeout-stop), forcefully terminate it.

    The default on unix is \"SIGTERM\".

    Input is parsed as a full signal name (like \"SIGTERM\"), a short
    signal name (like \"TERM\"), or a signal number (like \"15\"). All
    input is case-insensitive.

    On Windows this option is technically supported but only supports
    the \"KILL\" event, as Watchexec cannot yet deliver other events.
    Windows doesnt have signals as such; instead it has termination
    (here called \"KILL\" or \"STOP\") and \"CTRL+C\", \"CTRL+BREAK\",
    and \"CTRL+CLOSE\" events. For portability the unix signals
    \"SIGKILL\", \"SIGINT\", \"SIGTERM\", and \"SIGHUP\" are
    respectively mapped to these.

**\--stop-timeout**=*TIMEOUT*

:   Time to wait for the command to exit gracefully

    This is used by the restart mode of \--on-busy-update. After the
    graceful stop signal is sent, Watchexec will wait for the command to
    exit. If it hasnt exited after this time, it is forcefully
    terminated.

    Takes a unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as
    \"5min 20s\". Providing a unit-less value is deprecated and will
    warn; it will be an error in the future.

    The default is 10 seconds. Set to 0 to immediately force-kill the
    command.

    This has no practical effect on Windows as the command is always
    forcefully terminated; see \--stop-signal for why.

**\--delay-run**=*DURATION*

:   Sleep before running the command

    This option will cause Watchexec to sleep for the specified amount
    of time before running the command, after an event is detected. This
    is like using \"sleep 5 && command\" in a shell, but portable and
    slightly more efficient.

    Takes a unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as
    \"2min 5s\". Providing a unit-less value is deprecated and will
    warn; it will be an error in the future.

**\--workdir**=*DIRECTORY*

:   Set the working directory

    By default, the working directory of the command is the working
    directory of Watchexec. You can change that with this option. Note
    that paths may be less intuitive to use with this.

# DEBUGGING

**\--print-events**

:   Print events that trigger actions

    This prints the events that triggered the action when handling it
    (after debouncing), in a human readable form. This is useful for
    debugging filters.

    Use -vvv instead when you need more diagnostic information.

**-v**, **\--verbose**

:   Set diagnostic log level

    This enables diagnostic logging, which is useful for investigating
    bugs or gaining more insight into faulty filters or \"missing\"
    events. Use multiple times to increase verbosity.

    Goes up to -vvvv. When submitting bug reports, default to a -vvv log
    level.

    You may want to use with \--log-file to avoid polluting your
    terminal.

    Setting \$RUST_LOG also works, and takes precedence, but is not
    recommended. However, using \$RUST_LOG is the only way to get logs
    from before these options are parsed.

**\--log-file**=*PATH*

:   Write diagnostic logs to a file

    This writes diagnostic logs to a file, instead of the terminal, in
    JSON format. If a log level was not already specified, this will set
    it to -vvv.

    If a path is not provided, the default is the working directory.
    Note that with \--ignore-nothing, the write events to the log will
    likely get picked up by Watchexec, causing a loop; prefer setting a
    path outside of the watched directory.

    If the path provided is a directory, a file will be created in that
    directory. The file name will be the current date and time, in the
    format watchexec.YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ.log.

# EVENTS

**-o**, **\--on-busy-update**=*MODE*

:   What to do when receiving events while the command is running

    Default is to do-nothing, which ignores events while the command is
    running, so that changes that occur due to the command are ignored,
    like compilation outputs. You can also use queue which will run the
    command once again when the current run has finished if any events
    occur while its running, or restart, which terminates the running
    command and starts a new one. Finally, theres signal, which only
    sends a signal; this can be useful with programs that can reload
    their configuration without a full restart.

    The signal can be specified with the \--signal option.

**-r**, **\--restart**

:   Restart the process if its still running

    This is a shorthand for \--on-busy-update=restart.

**-s**, **\--signal**=*SIGNAL*

:   Send a signal to the process when its still running

    Specify a signal to send to the process when its still running. This
    implies \--on-busy-update=signal; otherwise the signal used when
    that mode is restart is controlled by \--stop-signal.

    See the long documentation for \--stop-signal for syntax.

    Signals are not supported on Windows at the moment, and will always
    be overridden to kill. See \--stop-signal for more on Windows
    \"signals\".

**\--map-signal**=*SIGNAL:SIGNAL*

:   Translate signals from the OS to signals to send to the command

    Takes a pair of signal names, separated by a colon, such as
    \"TERM:INT\" to map SIGTERM to SIGINT. The first signal is the one
    received by watchexec, and the second is the one sent to the
    command. The second can be omitted to discard the first signal, such
    as \"TERM:\" to not do anything on SIGTERM.

    If SIGINT or SIGTERM are mapped, then they no longer quit Watchexec.
    Besides making it hard to quit Watchexec itself, this is useful to
    send pass a Ctrl-C to the command without also terminating Watchexec
    and the underlying program with it, e.g. with \"INT:INT\".

    This option can be specified multiple times to map multiple signals.

    Signal syntax is case-insensitive for short names (like \"TERM\",
    \"USR2\") and long names (like \"SIGKILL\", \"SIGHUP\"). Signal
    numbers are also supported (like \"15\", \"31\"). On Windows, the
    forms \"STOP\", \"CTRL+C\", and \"CTRL+BREAK\" are also supported to
    receive, but Watchexec cannot yet deliver other \"signals\" than a
    STOP.

**-d**, **\--debounce**=*TIMEOUT*

:   Time to wait for new events before taking action

    When an event is received, Watchexec will wait for up to this amount
    of time before handling it (such as running the command). This is
    essential as what you might perceive as a single change may actually
    emit many events, and without this behaviour, Watchexec would run
    much too often. Additionally, its not infrequent that file writes
    are not atomic, and each write may emit an event, so this is a good
    way to avoid running a command while a file is partially written.

    An alternative use is to set a high value (like \"30min\" or
    longer), to save power or bandwidth on intensive tasks, like an
    ad-hoc backup script. In those use cases, note that every
    accumulated event will build up in memory.

    Takes a unit-less value in milliseconds, or a time span value such
    as \"5sec 20ms\". Providing a unit-less value is deprecated and will
    warn; it will be an error in the future.

    The default is 50 milliseconds. Setting to 0 is highly discouraged.

**\--stdin-quit**

:   Exit when stdin closes

    This watches the stdin file descriptor for EOF, and exits Watchexec
    gracefully when it is closed. This is used by some process managers
    to avoid leaving zombie processes around.

**-p**, **\--postpone**

:   Wait until first change before running command

    By default, Watchexec will run the command once immediately. With
    this option, it will instead wait until an event is detected before
    running the command as normal.

**\--poll**=*INTERVAL*

:   Poll for filesystem changes

    By default, and where available, Watchexec uses the operating
    systems native file system watching capabilities. This option
    disables that and instead uses a polling mechanism, which is less
    efficient but can work around issues with some file systems (like
    network shares) or edge cases.

    Optionally takes a unit-less value in milliseconds, or a time span
    value such as \"2s 500ms\", to use as the polling interval. If not
    specified, the default is 30 seconds. Providing a unit-less value is
    deprecated and will warn; it will be an error in the future.

    Aliased as \--force-poll.

**\--emit-events-to**=*MODE*

:   Configure event emission

    Watchexec can emit event information when running a command, which
    can be used by the child process to target specific changed files.

    One thing to take care with is assuming inherent behaviour where
    there is only chance. Notably, it could appear as if the \`RENAMED\`
    variable contains both the original and the new path being renamed.
    In previous versions, it would even appear on some platforms as if
    the original always came before the new. However, none of this was
    true. Its impossible to reliably and portably know which changed
    path is the old or new, \"half\" renames may appear (only the
    original, only the new), \"unknown\" renames may appear (change was
    a rename, but whether it was the old or new isnt known), rename
    events might split across two debouncing boundaries, and so on.

    This option controls where that information is emitted. It defaults
    to none, which doesnt emit event information at all. The other
    options are environment (deprecated), stdio, file, json-stdio, and
    json-file.

    The stdio and file modes are text-based: stdio writes absolute paths
    to the stdin of the command, one per line, each prefixed with
    \`create:\`, \`remove:\`, \`rename:\`, \`modify:\`, or \`other:\`,
    then closes the handle; file writes the same thing to a temporary
    file, and its path is given with the \$WATCHEXEC_EVENTS_FILE
    environment variable.

    There are also two JSON modes, which are based on JSON objects and
    can represent the full set of events Watchexec handles. Heres an
    example of a folder being created on Linux:

    \`\`\`json { \"tags\": \[ { \"kind\": \"path\", \"absolute\":
    \"/home/user/your/new-folder\", \"filetype\": \"dir\" }, { \"kind\":
    \"fs\", \"simple\": \"create\", \"full\": \"Create(Folder)\" }, {
    \"kind\": \"source\", \"source\": \"filesystem\", } \],
    \"metadata\": { \"notify-backend\": \"inotify\" } } \`\`\`

    The fields are as follows:

    \- \`tags\`, structured event data. - \`tags\[\].kind\`, which can
    be: \* path, along with: + \`absolute\`, an absolute path. +
    \`filetype\`, a file type if known (dir, file, symlink, other). \*
    fs: + \`simple\`, the \"simple\" event type (access, create, modify,
    remove, or other). + \`full\`, the \"full\" event type, which is too
    complex to fully describe here, but looks like
    General(Precise(Specific)). \* source, along with: + \`source\`, the
    source of the event (filesystem, keyboard, mouse, os, time,
    internal). \* keyboard, along with: + \`keycode\`. Currently only
    the value eof is supported. \* process, for events caused by
    processes: + \`pid\`, the process ID. \* signal, for signals sent to
    Watchexec: + \`signal\`, the normalised signal name (hangup,
    interrupt, quit, terminate, user1, user2). \* completion, for when a
    command ends: + \`disposition\`, the exit disposition (success,
    error, signal, stop, exception, continued). + \`code\`, the exit,
    signal, stop, or exception code. - \`metadata\`, additional
    information about the event.

    The json-stdio mode will emit JSON events to the standard input of
    the command, one per line, then close stdin. The json-file mode will
    create a temporary file, write the events to it, and provide the
    path to the file with the \$WATCHEXEC_EVENTS_FILE environment
    variable.

    Finally, the environment mode was the default until 2.0. It sets
    environment variables with the paths of the affected files, for
    filesystem events:

    \$WATCHEXEC_COMMON_PATH is set to the longest common path of all of
    the below variables, and so should be prepended to each path to
    obtain the full/real path. Then:

    \- \$WATCHEXEC_CREATED_PATH is set when files/folders were created -
    \$WATCHEXEC_REMOVED_PATH is set when files/folders were removed -
    \$WATCHEXEC_RENAMED_PATH is set when files/folders were renamed -
    \$WATCHEXEC_WRITTEN_PATH is set when files/folders were modified -
    \$WATCHEXEC_META_CHANGED_PATH is set when files/folders metadata
    were modified - \$WATCHEXEC_OTHERWISE_CHANGED_PATH is set for every
    other kind of pathed event

    Multiple paths are separated by the system path separator, ; on
    Windows and : on unix. Within each variable, paths are deduplicated
    and sorted in binary order (i.e. neither Unicode nor locale aware).

    This is the legacy mode, is deprecated, and will be removed in the
    future. The environment is a very restricted space, while also
    limited in what it can usefully represent. Large numbers of files
    will either cause the environment to be truncated, or may error or
    crash the process entirely. The \$WATCHEXEC_COMMON_PATH is also
    unintuitive, as demonstrated by the multiple confused queries that
    have landed in my inbox over the years.

# FILTERING

**-w**, **\--watch**=*PATH*

:   Watch a specific file or directory

    By default, Watchexec watches the current directory.

    When watching a single file, its often better to watch the
    containing directory instead, and filter on the filename. Some
    editors may replace the file with a new one when saving, and some
    platforms may not detect that or further changes.

    Upon starting, Watchexec resolves a \"project origin\" from the
    watched paths. See the help for \--project-origin for more
    information.

    This option can be specified multiple times to watch multiple files
    or directories.

    The special value /dev/null, provided as the only path watched, will
    cause Watchexec to not watch any paths. Other event sources (like
    signals or key events) may still be used.

**-W**, **\--watch-non-recursive**=*PATH*

:   Watch a specific directory, non-recursively

    Unlike -w, folders watched with this option are not recursed into.

    This option can be specified multiple times to watch multiple
    directories non-recursively.

**-F**, **\--watch-file**=*PATH*

:   Watch files and directories from a file

    Each line in the file will be interpreted as if given to -w.

    For more complex uses (like watching non-recursively), use the
    argfile capability: build a file containing command-line options and
    pass it to watchexec with \`@path/to/argfile\`.

    The special value - will read from STDIN; this in incompatible with
    \--stdin-quit.

**\--no-vcs-ignore**

:   Dont load gitignores

    Among other VCS exclude files, like for Mercurial, Subversion,
    Bazaar, DARCS, Fossil. Note that Watchexec will detect which of
    these is in use, if any, and only load the relevant files. Both
    global (like \~/.gitignore) and local (like .gitignore) files are
    considered.

    This option is useful if you want to watch files that are ignored by
    Git.

**\--no-project-ignore**

:   Dont load project-local ignores

    This disables loading of project-local ignore files, like .gitignore
    or .ignore in the watched project. This is contrasted with
    \--no-vcs-ignore, which disables loading of Git and other VCS ignore
    files, and with \--no-global-ignore, which disables loading of
    global or user ignore files, like \~/.gitignore or
    \~/.config/watchexec/ignore.

    Supported project ignore files:

    \- Git: .gitignore at project root and child directories,
    .git/info/exclude, and the file pointed to by \`core.excludesFile\`
    in .git/config. - Mercurial: .hgignore at project root and child
    directories. - Bazaar: .bzrignore at project root. - Darcs:
    \_darcs/prefs/boring - Fossil: .fossil-settings/ignore-glob -
    Ripgrep/Watchexec/generic: .ignore at project root and child
    directories.

    VCS ignore files (Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, Darcs, Fossil) are only
    used if the corresponding VCS is discovered to be in use for the
    project/origin. For example, a .bzrignore in a Git repository will
    be discarded.

**\--no-global-ignore**

:   Dont load global ignores

    This disables loading of global or user ignore files, like
    \~/.gitignore, \~/.config/watchexec/ignore, or
    %APPDATA%\\Bazzar\\2.0\\ignore. Contrast with \--no-vcs-ignore and
    \--no-project-ignore.

    Supported global ignore files

    \- Git (if core.excludesFile is set): the file at that path - Git
    (otherwise): the first found of \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore,
    %APPDATA%/.gitignore, %USERPROFILE%/.gitignore,
    \$HOME/.config/git/ignore, \$HOME/.gitignore. - Bazaar: the first
    found of %APPDATA%/Bazzar/2.0/ignore, \$HOME/.bazaar/ignore. -
    Watchexec: the first found of \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/watchexec/ignore,
    %APPDATA%/watchexec/ignore, %USERPROFILE%/.watchexec/ignore,
    \$HOME/.watchexec/ignore.

    Like for project files, Git and Bazaar global files will only be
    used for the corresponding VCS as used in the project.

**\--no-default-ignore**

:   Dont use internal default ignores

    Watchexec has a set of default ignore patterns, such as editor swap
    files, \`\*.pyc\`, \`\*.pyo\`, \`.DS_Store\`, \`.bzr\`, \`\_darcs\`,
    \`.fossil-settings\`, \`.git\`, \`.hg\`, \`.pijul\`, \`.svn\`, and
    Watchexec log files.

**\--no-discover-ignore**

:   Dont discover ignore files at all

    This is a shorthand for \--no-global-ignore, \--no-vcs-ignore,
    \--no-project-ignore, but even more efficient as it will skip all
    the ignore discovery mechanisms from the get go.

    Note that default ignores are still loaded, see
    \--no-default-ignore.

**\--ignore-nothing**

:   Dont ignore anything at all

    This is a shorthand for \--no-discover-ignore, \--no-default-ignore.

    Note that ignores explicitly loaded via other command line options,
    such as \--ignore or \--ignore-file, will still be used.

**-e**, **\--exts**=*EXTENSIONS*

:   Filename extensions to filter to

    This is a quick filter to only emit events for files with the given
    extensions. Extensions can be given with or without the leading dot
    (e.g. js or .js). Multiple extensions can be given by repeating the
    option or by separating them with commas.

**-f**, **\--filter**=*PATTERN*

:   Filename patterns to filter to

    Provide a glob-like filter pattern, and only events for files
    matching the pattern will be emitted. Multiple patterns can be given
    by repeating the option. Events that are not from files (e.g.
    signals, keyboard events) will pass through untouched.

**\--filter-file**=*PATH*

:   Files to load filters from

    Provide a path to a file containing filters, one per line. Empty
    lines and lines starting with \# are ignored. Uses the same pattern
    format as the \--filter option.

    This can also be used via the \$WATCHEXEC_FILTER_FILES environment
    variable.

**\--project-origin**=*DIRECTORY*

:   Set the project origin

    Watchexec will attempt to discover the projects \"origin\" (or
    \"root\") by searching for a variety of markers, like files or
    directory patterns. It does its best but sometimes gets it it wrong,
    and you can override that with this option.

    The project origin is used to determine the path of certain ignore
    files, which VCS is being used, the meaning of a leading / in
    filtering patterns, and maybe more in the future.

    When set, Watchexec will also not bother searching, which can be
    significantly faster.

**-j**, **\--filter-prog**=*EXPRESSION*

:   Filter programs.

    Provide your own custom filter programs in jaq (similar to jq)
    syntax. Programs are given an event in the same format as described
    in \--emit-events-to and must return a boolean. Invalid programs
    will make watchexec fail to start; use -v to see program runtime
    errors.

    In addition to the jaq stdlib, watchexec adds some custom filter
    definitions:

    \- path \| file_meta returns file metadata or null if the file does
    not exist.

    \- path \| file_size returns the size of the file at path, or null
    if it does not exist.

    \- path \| file_read(bytes) returns a string with the first n bytes
    of the file at path. If the file is smaller than n bytes, the whole
    file is returned. There is no filter to read the whole file at once
    to encourage limiting the amount of data read and processed.

    \- string \| hash, and path \| file_hash return the hash of the
    string or file at path. No guarantee is made about the algorithm
    used: treat it as an opaque value.

    \- any \| kv_store(key), kv_fetch(key), and kv_clear provide a
    simple key-value store. Data is kept in memory only, there is no
    persistence. Consistency is not guaranteed.

    \- any \| printout, any \| printerr, and any \| log(level) will
    print or log any given value to stdout, stderr, or the log (levels =
    error, warn, info, debug, trace), and pass the value through (so
    \[1\] \| log(\"debug\") \| .\[\] will produce a 1 and log \[1\]).

    All filtering done with such programs, and especially those using kv
    or filesystem access, is much slower than the other filtering
    methods. If filtering is too slow, events will back up and stall
    watchexec. Take care when designing your filters.

    If the argument to this option starts with an @, the rest of the
    argument is taken to be the path to a file containing a jaq program.

    Jaq programs are run in order, after all other filters, and
    short-circuit: if a filter (jaq or not) rejects an event, execution
    stops there, and no other filters are run. Additionally, they stop
    after outputting the first value, so youll want to use any or all
    when iterating, otherwise only the first item will be processed,
    which can be quite confusing!

    \<https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/discussions/592\>.

    \## Examples:

    Regexp ignore filter on paths:

    all(.tags\[\] \| select(.kind == \"path\"); .absolute \|
    test(\"\[.\]test\[.\]js\$\")) \| not

    Pass any event that creates a file:

    any(.tags\[\] \| select(.kind == \"fs\"); .simple == \"create\")

    Pass events that touch executable files:

    any(.tags\[\] \| select(.kind == \"path\" && .filetype == \"file\");
    .absolute \| metadata \| .executable)

    Ignore files that start with shebangs:

    any(.tags\[\] \| select(.kind == \"path\" && .filetype == \"file\");
    .absolute \| read(2) == \"#!\") \| not

**-i**, **\--ignore**=*PATTERN*

:   Filename patterns to filter out

    Provide a glob-like filter pattern, and events for files matching
    the pattern will be excluded. Multiple patterns can be given by
    repeating the option. Events that are not from files (e.g. signals,
    keyboard events) will pass through untouched.

**\--ignore-file**=*PATH*

:   Files to load ignores from

    Provide a path to a file containing ignores, one per line. Empty
    lines and lines starting with \# are ignored. Uses the same pattern
    format as the \--ignore option.

    This can also be used via the \$WATCHEXEC_IGNORE_FILES environment
    variable.

**\--fs-events**=*EVENTS*

:   Filesystem events to filter to

    This is a quick filter to only emit events for the given types of
    filesystem changes. Choose from access, create, remove, rename,
    modify, metadata. Multiple types can be given by repeating the
    option or by separating them with commas. By default, this is all
    types except for access.

    This may apply filtering at the kernel level when possible, which
    can be more efficient, but may be more confusing when reading the
    logs.

**\--no-meta**

:   Dont emit fs events for metadata changes

    This is a shorthand for \--fs-events create,remove,rename,modify.
    Using it alongside the \--fs-events option is non-sensical and not
    allowed.

# OUTPUT

**-c**, **\--clear**=*MODE*

:   Clear screen before running command

    If this doesnt completely clear the screen, try \--clear=reset.

**-N**, **\--notify**

:   Alert when commands start and end

    With this, Watchexec will emit a desktop notification when a command
    starts and ends, on supported platforms. On unsupported platforms,
    it may silently do nothing, or log a warning.

**\--color**=*MODE* \[default: auto\]

:   When to use terminal colours

    Setting the environment variable \`NO_COLOR\` to any value is
    equivalent to \`\--color=never\`.

**\--timings**

:   Print how long the command took to run

    This may not be exactly accurate, as it includes some overhead from
    Watchexec itself. Use the \`time\` utility, high-precision timers,
    or benchmarking tools for more accurate results.

**-q**, **\--quiet**

:   Dont print starting and stopping messages

    By default Watchexec will print a message when the command starts
    and stops. This option disables this behaviour, so only the commands
    output, warnings, and errors will be printed.

**\--bell**

:   Ring the terminal bell on command completion

# EXTRA

Use \@argfile as first argument to load arguments from the file argfile
(one argument per line) which will be inserted in place of the \@argfile
(further arguments on the CLI will override or add onto those in the
file).
