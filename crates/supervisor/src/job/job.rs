/// A handle to a job task spawned in the supervisor.
///
/// A job is a task which manages a [`Command`]. It is responsible for spawning the command's
/// program, for handling messages which control it, for managing the program's lifetime, and for
/// collecting its exit status and some timing information.
///
/// Most of the methods here queue [`Control`]s to the job task and return [`Ticket`]s. Controls
/// execute in order, except where noted. Tickets are futures which resolve when the corresponding
/// control has been run. Unlike most futures, tickets don't need to be polled for controls to make
/// progress; the future is only used to signal completion. Dropping a ticket will not drop the
/// control, so it's safe to do so if you don't care about when the control completes.
///
/// Note that controls are not guaranteed to run, like if the job task stops or panics before a
/// control is processed. If a job task stops gracefully, all pending tickets will resolve
/// immediately. If a job task panics (outside of hooks, panics are bugs!), pending tickets will
/// never resolve.
///
/// This struct is cloneable (internally it is made of Arcs). Dropping the last instance of a Job
/// will close the job's control queue, which will cause the job task to stop gracefully. Note that
/// a task graceful stop is not the same as a graceful stop of the contained command; when the job
/// drops, the command will be dropped in turn, and forcefully terminated via `kill_on_drop`.
