# Watchexec filterer: tagged

_Experimental filterer using tagged filters._

- **[API documentation][docs]**.
- Licensed under [Apache 2.0][license].
- Status: soft-deprecated.

The tagged filterer is not in use in the Watchexec CLI, but this crate will continue being updated
until and unless it becomes too much of a pain to do so, for third party users. It is expected that
some of the code will eventually be reused for a more generic filter crate without the tagged syntax.
