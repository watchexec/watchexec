	/// Invalid programs will make watchexec fail to start; use '-v' to see program runtime errors.
	///
	/// In addition to the jaq stdlib, watchexec adds some custom filter definitions:
	///
	///   - 'path | file_meta' returns file metadata or null if the file does not exist.
	///
	///   - 'path | file_size' returns the size of the file at path, or null if it does not exist.
	///
	///   - 'path | file_read(bytes)' returns a string with the first n bytes of the file at path.
	///     If the file is smaller than n bytes, the whole file is returned. There is no filter to
	///     read the whole file at once to encourage limiting the amount of data read and processed.
	///
	///   - 'string | hash', and 'path | file_hash' return the hash of the string or file at path.
	///     No guarantee is made about the algorithm used: treat it as an opaque value.
	///
	///   - 'any | kv_store(key)', 'kv_fetch(key)', and 'kv_clear' provide a simple key-value store.
	///     Data is kept in memory only, there is no persistence. Consistency is not guaranteed.
	///
	///   - 'any | printout', 'any | printerr', and 'any | log(level)' will print or log any given
	///     value to stdout, stderr, or the log (levels = error, warn, info, debug, trace), and
	///     pass the value through (so '[1] | log("debug") | .[]' will produce a '1' and log '[1]').
	///
	/// All filtering done with such programs, and especially those using kv or filesystem access,
	/// is much slower than the other filtering methods. If filtering is too slow, events will back
	/// up and stall watchexec. Take care when designing your filters.
	///
	/// If the argument to this option starts with an '@', the rest of the argument is taken to be
	/// the path to a file containing a jaq program.
	///
	/// Jaq programs are run in order, after all other filters, and short-circuit: if a filter (jaq
	/// or not) rejects an event, execution stops there, and no other filters are run. Additionally,
	/// they stop after outputting the first value, so you'll want to use 'any' or 'all' when
	/// iterating, otherwise only the first item will be processed, which can be quite confusing!
	///
	/// Find user-contributed programs or submit your own useful ones at
	/// <https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/discussions/592>.

	/// Regexp ignore filter on paths:
	///
	///   'all(.tags[] | select(.kind == "path"); .absolute | test("[.]test[.]js$")) | not'
