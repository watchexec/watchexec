# Watchexec CLI

A simple standalone tool that watches a path and runs a command whenever it detects modifications.

Example use cases:

* Automatically run unit tests
* Run linters/syntax checkers

## Features

* Simple invocation and use
* Runs on Linux, Mac, Windows, and more
* Monitors current directory and all subdirectories for changes
    * Uses efficient event polling mechanism (on Linux, Mac, Windows, BSD)
* Coalesces multiple filesystem events into one, for editors that use swap/backup files during saving
* By default, uses `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, and other such files to determine which files to ignore notifications for
* Support for watching files with a specific extension
* Support for filtering/ignoring events based on [glob patterns](https://docs.rs/globset/*/globset/#syntax)
* Launches the command in a new process group (can be disabled with `--no-process-group`)
* Optionally clears screen between executions
* Optionally restarts the command with every modification (good for servers)
* Optionally sends a desktop notification on command start and end
* Does not require a language runtime
* Sets the following environment variables in the process:

    `$WATCHEXEC_COMMON_PATH` is set to the longest common path of all of the below variables, and so should be prepended to each path to obtain the full/real path.

    | Variable name | Event kind |
    |---|---|
    | `$WATCHEXEC_CREATED_PATH` | files/folders were created |
    | `$WATCHEXEC_REMOVED_PATH` | files/folders were removed |
    | `$WATCHEXEC_RENAMED_PATH` | files/folders were renamed |
    | `$WATCHEXEC_WRITTEN_PATH` | files/folders were modified |
    | `$WATCHEXEC_META_CHANGED_PATH` | files/folders' metadata were modified |
    | `$WATCHEXEC_OTHERWISE_CHANGED_PATH` | every other kind of event |

    These variables may contain multiple paths: these are separated by the platform's path separator, as with the `PATH` system environment variable. On Unix that is `:`, and on Windows `;`. Within each variable, paths are deduplicated and sorted in binary order (i.e. neither Unicode nor locale aware).

    This can be disabled or limited with `--no-environment` (doesn't set any of these variables) and `--no-meta` (ignores metadata changes).

## Anti-Features

* Not tied to any particular language or ecosystem
* Not tied to Git or the presence of a repository/project
* Does not require a cryptic command line involving `xargs`

## Simple Usage Examples

Watch all JavaScript, CSS and HTML files in the current directory and all subdirectories for changes, running `make` when a change is detected:

    $ watchexec --exts js,css,html make

Call `make test` when any file changes in this directory/subdirectory, except for everything below `target`:

    $ watchexec -i "target/**" make test

Call `ls -la` when any file changes in this directory/subdirectory:

    $ watchexec -- ls -la

Call/restart `python server.py` when any Python file in the current directory (and all subdirectories) changes:

    $ watchexec -e py -r python server.py

Call/restart `my_server` when any file in the current directory (and all subdirectories) changes, sending `SIGKILL` to stop the command:

    $ watchexec -r -s SIGKILL my_server

Send a SIGHUP to the command upon changes (Note: using `-n` here we're executing `my_server` directly, instead of wrapping it in a shell:

    $ watchexec -n -s SIGHUP my_server

Run `make` when any file changes, using the `.gitignore` file in the current directory to filter:

    $ watchexec make

Run `make` when any file in `lib` or `src` changes:

    $ watchexec -w lib -w src make

Run `bundle install` when the `Gemfile` changes:

    $ watchexec -w Gemfile bundle install

Run two commands:

    $ watchexec 'date; make'

If you come from `entr`, note that the watchexec command is run in a shell by default. You can use `-n` or `--shell=none` to not do that:

    $ watchexec -n -- echo ';' lorem ipsum

On Windows, you may prefer to use Powershell:

    $ watchexec --shell=powershell -- test-connection localhost

## Complex Usage Examples 

Turn a plain converter tool like PlantUML or Pandoc into a powerful live-editing tool, either as a script

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    set -Eeuo pipefail
    
    SOURCE="test.puml"            # Define source file
    TARGET="test.png"             # Define conversion target file
    CONVERT="plantuml $SOURCE"    # Define how to convert source to target
    VIEW="feh $TARGET"            # Define how to open target file
    if [ ! -f $TARGET ]; then $CONVERT; fi # Ensure target file exists for opening
    $VIEW &                                # Open target file in viewer in the background
    watchexec --filter $SOURCE -- $CONVERT    # Update target file on any source file change

or condensed as a single line
   
    # Bash
    $ SOURCE="test.puml"; TARGET="test.png"; CONVERT="plantuml $SOURCE"; VIEW="feh $TARGET"; if [ ! -f $TARGET ]; then $CONVERT; fi; ($VIEW &); watchexec -f $SOURCE -- $CONVERT
    # Zsh
    $ SOURCE="test.puml"; TARGET="test.png"; CONVERT="plantuml $SOURCE"; VIEW="feh $TARGET"; if [ ! -f $TARGET ]; then $CONVERT; fi; ($=VIEW &); watchexec -f $SOURCE -- $CONVERT

Replace [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) with another converter like [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/): 
`plantuml $SOURCE` turns into `pandoc $SOURCE --output $TARGET`, 
Similarly, replace the [Feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) image viewer with another viewer for your target file like the PDF viewer [Evince](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince): `feh $TARGET` turns into `evince $TARGET`.
