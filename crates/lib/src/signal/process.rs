pub enum SubSignal {
	/// Indicate that the terminal is disconnected.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGHUP`. On Windows, this is ignored for now but may be supported in the
	/// future (see [#219](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/issues/219)).
	///
	/// Despite its nominal purpose, on Unix this signal is often used to reload configuration files.
	Hangup,

	/// Indicate to the kernel that the process should stop.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGKILL`. On Windows, this is `TerminateProcess`.
	///
	/// This signal is not handled by the process, but directly by the kernel, and thus cannot be
	/// intercepted. Subprocesses may exit in inconsistent states.
	ForceStop,

	/// Indicate that the process should stop.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGINT`. On Windows, this is ignored for now but may be supported in the
	/// future (see [#219](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/issues/219)).
	///
	/// This signal generally indicates an action taken by the user, so it may be handled
	/// differently than a termination.
	Interrupt,

	/// Indicate that the process is to stop, the kernel will then dump its core.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGQUIT`. On Windows, it is ignored.
	///
	/// This is rarely used.
	Quit,

	/// Indicate that the process should stop.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGTERM`. On Windows, this is ignored for now but may be supported in the
	/// future (see [#219](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec/issues/219)).
	///
	/// On Unix, this signal generally indicates an action taken by the system, so it may be handled
	/// differently than an interruption.
	Terminate,

	/// Indicate an application-defined behaviour should happen.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGUSR1`. On Windows, it is ignored.
	///
	/// This signal is generally used to start debugging.
	User1,

	/// Indicate an application-defined behaviour should happen.
	///
	/// On Unix, this is `SIGUSR2`. On Windows, it is ignored.
	///
	/// This signal is generally used to reload configuration.
	User2,

	/// Indicate using a custom signal.
	///
	/// Internally, this is converted to a [`nix::Signal`](https://docs.rs/nix/*/nix/sys/signal/enum.Signal.html)
	/// but for portability this variant is a raw `i32`.
	///
	/// Invalid signals on the current platform will be ignored. Does nothing on Windows.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```
	/// # #[cfg(unix)]
	/// # {
	/// use watchexec::signal::process::SubSignal;
	/// use nix::sys::signal::Signal;
	/// assert_eq!(SubSignal::Custom(6), SubSignal::from(Signal::SIGABRT as i32));
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// On Unix the [`from_nix`][SubSignal::from_nix] method should be preferred if converting from
	/// Nix's `Signal` type:
	///
	/// ```
	/// # #[cfg(unix)]
	/// # {
	/// use watchexec::signal::process::SubSignal;
	/// use nix::sys::signal::Signal;
	/// assert_eq!(SubSignal::Custom(6), SubSignal::from_nix(Signal::SIGABRT));
